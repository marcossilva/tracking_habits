# AutoSampling: search for effective data sampling schedules

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13695.pdf

Again this is a theme that I don't deeply understand but skimming the article not much has caught my attention. They discuss about a sampling strategy on a given dataset stating that it's possible to achieve optimal results with the correct samplings. The trick is to find out which samplings are the best. It reminds me of some NAS techniques since several models have to be considered and compared to achieve marginal improvement in the final results.  The achievements are all in the order of +-1% in the final score but given the computing time necessary to achieve this seed and optimal result I would not consider this as valuable for many broad applications.
