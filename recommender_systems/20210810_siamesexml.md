# SiameseXML: Siamese Networks meet Extreme Classifiers with 100M Labels

This paper starts on fire!
> Deep extreme multi-label learning (XML) requires training deep architectures that can tag
a data point with its most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. XML
applications such as ad and product recommendation involve labels rarely seen during training
but which nevertheless hold the key to recommendations that delight users.

> Extreme Multi-label Learning (XML) involves
tagging a data point with its most relevant subset of labels
from an extremely large set. XML finds applications in myriad of ranking and recommendation tasks such as productto-product (Mittal et al., 2021a), product-to-query (Chang
et al., 2020a), query-to-product (Medini et al., 2019), queryto-bid-phrase (Dahiya et al., 2021), etc. (...) These accurately model the ranking
and recommendation tasks mentioned above and have attracted much attention recently (Chang et al., 2020a; Dahiya
et al., 2021; Medini et al., 2019; Mittal et al., 2021a).

In the end was mostly an optimization problem with an extensive math explanation.
