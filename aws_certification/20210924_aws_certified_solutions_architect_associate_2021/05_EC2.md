* Instance types: can control your available RAM, vCPU (cores available for parallel programming), bandwith and cost
* Security Groups are inbound and outbound rules that controls who can see who from where
* Among the classic ports we have 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for FTP, 2222 for SFTP
* We can directly connect to an EC2 instance using SSH (if it is available on the respective security group)
* The connection needs a PEM certificate file on the connection
* The EC2 can also be accessed through Instance Connect on browser
