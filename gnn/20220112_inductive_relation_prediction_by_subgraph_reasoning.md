# Inductive Relation Prediction by Subgraph Reasoning

An inductive quality is desirable because it's able to generalise to unseen data. 

GraIL shows inductive hability to reason rules over subgraphs structures. This generalizes to unseen noeds since the model learns to reason over subgraphs structures independent of node proprieties.

Doesn't use any node attributes, only relies on graph structure.
